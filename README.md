Wheatbin is Project Management Software with a responsive "mobile first" redesign. It combines Kanban methodology with the [Law of the Harvest]. 

[Wheatbin] is a software fork of [Kanboard] v1.0.22 by Frédéric Guillot (see the [diff]). It's a major overhaul of the UX/IU for a more streamlined workflow. And as with Kanboard, Wheatbin includes:

- Multiple boards with the ability to drag and drop tasks
- Open source and self-hosted
- Super simple installation
- Distributed under [MIT License](LICENSE)

See the **installation [instructions]**.

For Kanboard specific issues, go to [upstream] from/or the wheatbin [fork] please.
